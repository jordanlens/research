# Research & Data Visualization

A collection of open data and open research by the [USAID Jordan Local Enterprise Support Project](http://www.jordanlens.org).

## Infographics & Posters

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
ig <- expand.grid(lang = c("EN", "AR"),
                  topic = c("General_Profile", "Survey_Mechanism",
                  "Economic_Sectors", "Business_Registration"))
path <- "outputs/infographics/MSE_Infographics_"
ig <- dplyr::mutate(ig, link = paste0("[PDF](", path, topic, "_", lang, ".pdf), ",
                               "[PNG](", path, topic, "_", lang, ".png)"))
tab <- reshape2::dcast(topic~lang, data = ig)
tab$topic <- gsub("_", " ", tab$topic)
knitr::kable(tab)
```


## Dashboards

<a href="http://public.tableau.com/profile/usaidlens" target="_blank"><img style="float: right" src="figures/dashboard_icons.png" width="40%"></a>

USAID LENS develops dashboards available online on [Tableau Public](http://public.tableau.com/profile/usaidlens). These are meant to be interactive and engaging tools that quick quick access to the results of the survey.

Our infographics:

* [General Survey Results](http://public.tableau.com/profile/usaidlens#!/vizhome/CT_7/Categorical_EN)
* Memberships [coming soon]
* [Resource Use](http://public.tableau.com/profile/usaidlens#!/vizhome/BETAResourceUse/ResourceUse_EN)
* Financial Performance [coming soon]
* MSE Sectors [coming soon]


## Static Reports

### Governorate Reports

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(knitr)

md5shield <- function(files, name = "MD5", color = "blue", dir = file.path("~", "research")){
  out <- NULL
  for(file in files){
    md5 <- substr(digest::digest(file = file.path(dir, file)), 1, 10)
    shield <- paste0("https://img.shields.io/badge/", name, "-", md5,"-", color, ".svg")
    out <- c(out, paste0("![", md5, "](", shield, ")"))
  }
  out
}

rel_path <- function(area, lang){
  names  <- paste0("Summary Report - ", area, " (", lang, ").pdf")
  file.path("outputs", "reports", "gov_summaries", names)
}

get_info <- function(paths, proj = file.path("~", "research"), 
                     name = "English", color = "blue"){
  # add relative paths
  p <- list(path = paths)
  index <- which(file.exists(file.path(proj, paths)))
  
  # add md5
  p$md5 <- rep("", length(p$path))
  p$md5[index] <- md5shield(p$path[index], name = name, color = color)
  
  # convert to markdown links
  p$pdf <- rep("_coming soon_", length(p$path))
  p$pdf[index] <- paste0("[PDF](", p$path[index],") ")
  
  p
}


gov <- data.frame(Governorate = c("Amman", "Aqaba", "Irbid", "Karak", "Tafilah", "Zarqa")) %>%
  mutate(English = get_info(rel_path(Governorate, lang = "English"))[["pdf"]],
         Arabic = get_info(rel_path(Governorate, lang = "Arabic"))[["pdf"]],
         `Version (MD5 checksums)` = paste(get_info(rel_path(Governorate, lang = "English"))[["md5"]],
            get_info(rel_path(Governorate, lang = "Arabic"), name = "Arabic", color = "red")[["md5"]]))

kable(gov)
```

<i>NB: As USAID LENS aims to serve lesser-advantaged communitities in Jordan, "Amman" governorate excludes the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) in the MSE survey, and "Aqaba" governorate excludes the ASEZA free-zone.</i>

# Open Data

## MSE Survey

<a href="http://opendefinition.org/"><img src="http://assets.okfn.org/images/ok_buttons/od_80x15_red_green.png" alt="This material is Open Data" height="20" width="107" /></a> <a rel="license" href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/summary/"><img alt="Open Data Commons Attribution License v1.0" style="border-width:0" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ODC--BY_1.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square" /></a> <a href="http://5stardata.info/en/"><img src="http://lab.linkeddata.deri.ie/2010/lod-badges/img/data-badge-5.png" alt="five star open Web data" /></a> <br />

As the mainstay of its technical research, the 2014-15 survey of micro- and small-enterprises (MSE survey) is a valuable resource not only for USAID but also for government, other aid donors, and business service providers. A public release of the micro-data is made available by USAID LENS under the a [Open Data Commons Attribution License v1.0](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/).

USAID LENS plans to obtain [open data certification](https://certificates.theodi.org/en/) from the Open Data Institute and be compliant with [5-star level of open-data](http://5stardata.info/en/).

### Data Anonymization

Ensuring confidentiality of survey participants is an important part of the research process and a core tenant of the [Common Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Rule). Luckily, diclosure risk for most survey data is inherently low due to the fact that re-identification requires "respondent knowledge"-- that is, knowledge of whether a given individual participated in the study. Additionally, most questions asked in the MSE survey are fairly benign. Nonetheless, USAID LENS reviews the MSE survey has been put through _statistical disclosure control_ (SDC) prior to public release. The process is designed to assess the confidentiality of the information that the project releases about people and businesses.

Re-identification risk depends on a number of factors such as availability of match-able external data, sensitivity of given variables, technical skill of would-be intruders, as well as standalone and combinatorial identifiability of variables.

In preparation for the public release of the data, variables that are more readily available or incriminating have either been removed from the public release, collapsed into larger classes, converted to categorical bins (for continuous variables). In order to balance utility with privacy, data has not been scrambled or noise-injected.

### Open-Data Repositories

Additionally to being able to download the data via github, the MSE Survey will be made available on [figshare](https://figshare.com/) and [dryad](http://datadryad.org/) for greater dissemination among the scientific community.
